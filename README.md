join me on a programming adventure!

hereâ€™s my daisy resource page
    

for oopsy

actually this might be the most recent release for oopsy!!! make sure you install here.

Go here to install the toolchain and the oopsy package. first you install the toolchain (for flashing code)
(and next you install the oopsy package, for dumping code via MAX)

This guide can be dissected into just a few parts:

1) Installing the toolchain for your OS (MacOS or Windows)

If you've already been doing any development with Daisy, you've probably already got this set up and can skip ahead to the next section.

Oopsy compiles firmware for the Daisy platform under the hood, and can program that firmware to the device directly from Max. In order to do these things, a few extra tools are required:

    Make
    arm-none-eabi toolchain
    dfu-util

These are generally simple to install for each OS. See our MacOS Guide and Windows Guide for detailed steps.

Though, if you're on MacOS and already have Brew installed, all you need to do is paste this command into your terminal:

brew install make armmbed/formulae/arm-none-eabi-gcc dfu-util



2)  Downloading the Oopsy package and placing it in your Max 8/Packages folder

3)    Opening up one of the example patches and programming your Daisy

now you've done those things its time to flash code.
1) open up max.
2) create a new instantiation of "Daisy" object 
3) select which daisy device you'll use for code. either, Pod, Patch, or Peddle.
4) connect daisy to computer with usb cable
5) hold down the boot button and hit the reset button on the daisy. after releasing reset button you can release the boot button.
(allow accessory to connect) 
6) now press the big BANG button in max and the oopsy objct will convert your gen patcher to C++ and dump it on the daisy. 
7)
